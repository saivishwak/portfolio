       Built a standalone software with GUI using MATLAB for predesign analysis and plotting of super-sonic convergent- divergent rocket nozzle for incompressible fluids using Numerical method: Method of Characteristics for Rocket Nozzle and Analytical method: G.V Rao Nozzle Optimization. The software is capable of plotting perfect rocket nozzle contour using various parameters like ambient temperature, pressure inside combustion chamber, etc. The predicted nozzle contour data points can be exported into any CAD software for 3D Modelling.
